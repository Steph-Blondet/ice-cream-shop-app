# ICE CREAM APP

EScream is a full stack application where the user can create an account and add custom ice cream creations to their profile.

When the user visits the web app, they have to register and then login in order to add an ice cream to their account. Once an ice cream is created, they can see their creation in their personal profile.

The user has the ability to edit, update, create and delete ice creams in their profile and they can also edit, update and delete their personal profile.

This full stack application is responsive so it can be viewed in different viewport sizes.

## Technologies Used
- MVC file structure
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS for server-side rendering
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- Two set of RESTful routes for both resources (users and ice creams)
- Heroku for deployment
- HTML, CSS and JS

## Future Features
- Add password encryption
- Add Google Maps to the location section on the index page
- The ability to add an ice cream only when the user is logged in and remove the 'Add ice cream' button from the 'Ice Creams' page so only registered users can create ice creams
- Have the 'New Ice Creams' page read who is logged in and automatically add that new ice cream to that specific user. Remove the 'Find your user name' dropdown menu from this page after this has been completed.
- Add footer on pages with forms
